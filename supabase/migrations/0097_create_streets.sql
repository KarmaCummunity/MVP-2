-- 0097_create_streets | Canonical Israeli street list, keyed by city.
-- Sourced from data.gov.il package 321 (resource 9ad3862c-8391-4b2f-84a4-2d4c68625f4b).
-- Seeded in 0098_seed_streets.sql.
--
-- Notes:
--   * (city_id, street_id) is the natural key — street_id is unique per city,
--     not globally. No surrogate id column.
--   * No name_en column: the source dataset has no English street names.
--   * RLS mirrors public.cities — public read for anon + authenticated; writes
--     happen only via the service role (migrations).
--   * Code 9000 in street_id is the source's "the village itself" sentinel —
--     kept verbatim; for 486 small settlements it is the only canonical entry.
--   * `on delete cascade` because a city deletion (extremely rare) should drop
--     its dependent street rows; orphaned streets serve no purpose.
