All the data will always be out in the open — we don\'t hide, and the road is part of the story.',

      bio: 'Nave, founder of Karma. I built this project after realizing that the world of giving isn\'t short on money — it\'s short on knowledge, transparency, and technology.',
      bioFull:
        'The world of philanthropy isn\'t short on money. It\'s short on knowledge, transparency, technology, and efficiency.\n\n' +
        'I carried that insight for years without knowing this was my project. I grew up in a religious-Zionist family, and back in high school, thanks to an environment that pushed for excellence, I completed a degree in computer science. At the same time I began asking questions about religion and God, and in the end I left the faith with questions.\n\n' +
        'After a mixed pre-army program, a lot of philosophy, and an encounter with the many layers of Israeli society — I enlisted in the army in the MA"B unit — a technology unit in the Air Force where I developed code for fighter jets. \nUp until then, everywhere in my life I was surrounded by people who wanted to excel. In the army I saw the contrast: there were many smart, high-quality people, and very few who truly excelled; the projects were slow, there was a lack of personal attention and care for the individual, and the standard was mediocrity. That contrast taught me something about community. A community with a clear vision and strong tools has tremendous power.\n\n' +
        'I wanted to plant that same insight in the world of giving and philanthropy — what had worked on me and on those around me for years. But how do you turn people from all over the world into a strong community with a vision that pushes toward excellence and connection? And all without tools or money, without experience, and without a community. So I started small, a spark of an idea to connect gemachs (free-loan societies) to social networks, and that way harness those networks for doing good and giving. From there it rolled along — I consulted, took things apart and rebuilt them, and sharpened the idea. A new social network, for social good only. One place that centers every kind of social good in the world, from handing off belongings, money donations and volunteering, through donations of knowledge and food, all the way to hosting and blood and organ donation.\n\n' +
        'Today we\'re at the first step: an app for handing off belongings for free, in Hebrew, in Israel. We\'ll keep growing and expanding, advancing and improving, and of course we\'ll document it all for you! \n\n This is exactly where real things begin.',
