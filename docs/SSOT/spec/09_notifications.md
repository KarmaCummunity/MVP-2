# 2.9 Notifications

> **Status:** ✅ Implemented — All in-scope FRs shipped end-to-end. FR-NOTIF-004 (message_undeliverable) and FR-NOTIF-012 (account-deletion email) remain deferred — see TD-62 and TD-118 respectively. FR-NOTIF-016 (quiet hours) is out of MVP per spec. Web Push parity tracked under TD-65. ⚠️ Audit 2026-05-16: 4 🔴 — sign-out leaves device row active (TD-100 / FR-NOTIF-015 AC3); follow_started/approved tap routing broken (TD-73); ~50% of system-message pushes silently dropped (TD-74); FR-NOTIF-003 needs an AC2 foreground-suppression analogue. BACKLOG P2.13. See `docs/SSOT/audit/2026-05-16/04_chat_notifications.md`.



Prefix: `FR-NOTIF-*`

---

## Scope

The complete notification taxonomy for MVP. Notifications are delivered via push (mobile + Web Push) only — there is **no** in-app notifications screen in MVP (`PRD_MVP/08_Out_of_Scope_and_Future.md`).

The system has exactly two user-controllable categories (per `D-5`):

- **Critical** — actions the user must know about to operate the product correctly (chat messages, recipient marking, follow requests, removals, expiry).
- **Social** — courtesy updates that strengthen connection but are non-blocking (someone followed you, someone approved your request).

A user toggle exists per category. Both categories default to **on**.

## FR-NOTIF-001 — New chat message *(Critical)*

**Description.**
A new message in any conversation triggers a notification to the recipient.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.4.3, `04_User_Flows.md` Flow 6.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Title: sender's `display_name`. Body: the first 80 characters of the message text. Tap → conversation screen.
- AC2. Suppressed when the recipient is currently active in that exact conversation screen (foreground + same chat).
- AC3. Coalescing: multiple messages from the same sender within 60 seconds collapse into a single OS-level notification with an updated count.
- AC4. Disabled by `notif_critical = false`.

**Related.** Domain: `Notification`, `NotificationPreference`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-002 — Mention in support thread (Super Admin → user) *(Critical)*

**Description.**
A response from the Super Admin in the user's support thread is treated as a Critical message.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.4.4 (3rd entry), §3.5.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Same payload as `FR-NOTIF-001` but the title displays "Karma Community Support" instead of the literal Super Admin display name.
- AC2. Suppressing the support-thread notification individually is **not** allowed; the Critical category toggle is the only control.

**Related.** Domain: `Notification`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-003 — System message in any thread *(Critical)*

**Description.**
Every system-injected message into a chat thread emits a notification.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.4.4, `02_Personas_Roles.md` §2.2.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Includes notifications for moderation outcomes that drop a system message into the user's thread (e.g., a chat being moderation-hidden after report processing).
- AC2. Tap → the thread.

**Related.** Domain: `Notification`, `Message.kind = system`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-004 — Message no longer deliverable (suspension / deletion) *(Critical)*

**Description.**
If a message I sent failed to be delivered because the recipient's account was deleted or suspended after I sent it, I receive a passive notification.

**Source.**
- (Internal: privacy-respecting feedback to the sender.)

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Title: "Message could not be delivered". Body: "The recipient is no longer reachable."
- AC2. Tap → conversation screen with the failed message.
- AC3. Sent at most once per `(sender, chat)` pair within 24 hours, even if multiple messages failed.

**Related.** Domain: `Message`, `User.account_status`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-005 — Post expiring soon *(Critical)*

**Description.**
A post owner is informed 7 days before automatic expiry.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Triggered exactly once per post when `now() = created_at + 293 days`.
- AC2. Title: "Your post is expiring in 7 days". Body: post title. Tap → owner's view of the post.

**Related.** Domain: `Post`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-006 — Follow request received *(Social)*

**Description.**
The owner of a `Private` profile receives a notification on a new follow request.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Title: requester's `display_name`. Body: "Wants to follow you".
- AC2. Quick actions on the OS notification (where supported): "View", "Approve", "Reject".
- AC3. Tap (no quick action chosen) → Follow Requests screen (5.4).

**Related.** Domain: `Notification`, `FollowRequest`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-007 — Started following *(Social)*

**Description.**
A user is notified when someone starts following them in `Public` mode.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.2.4 (sub-section א).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Title: follower's `display_name`. Body: "Started following you".
- AC2. Tap → follower's profile.
- AC3. Coalescing: ≥3 followers within 60 minutes coalesce to "X new followers".
- AC4. Disabled by `notif_social = false`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-008 — Follow request approved *(Social)*

**Description.**
The requester receives a notification when their request is approved.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.2.4 (sub-section ב).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Title: target's `display_name`. Body: "Accepted your follow request".
- AC2. Tap → target's profile.

---

## FR-NOTIF-009 — Marked as recipient *(Critical)*

**Description.**
A user is notified the moment a post owner marks them as the recipient.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.3.6 (sub-section א), Decisions `D-5`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Title: owner's `display_name`. Body: "Marked you as the recipient of [post title]".
- AC2. Tap → recipient's view of the post (`FR-POST-017`).
- AC3. Always Critical regardless of social toggle.

---

## FR-NOTIF-010 — Recipient un-marked themselves *(Critical)*

**Description.**
The post owner is notified when the recipient removes their mark.

**Source.**
- Decisions: `D-7`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Title: recipient's `display_name`. Body: "Removed their recipient mark from [post title]".
- AC2. Tap → owner's view of the (now-`deleted_no_recipient`) post; from there the owner can reopen, re-mark, or let it expire.

---

## FR-NOTIF-011 — Content auto-removed *(Critical)*

**Description.**
The owner of an auto-removed target is notified.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.5, `04_User_Flows.md` Flow 9.A.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Title: "Your post was removed". Body: neutral language explaining the policy. Tap → a static help page.
- AC2. Suspended users do not receive notifications until the suspension lifts; the next sign-in attempt explains the suspension.

**Related.** Domain: `Notification`, `Report`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-012 — Account-deletion completion *(Critical)*

**Description.**
On final hard-deletion of an account (post 30-day cooldown), an email is sent (no push since there is no device left). Out of scope of push notifications but listed for completeness.

**Source.**
- Constraints: `R-MVP-Privacy-6`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Email is sent to the original verified address (when applicable) confirming permanent deletion.
- AC2. The email is not retried more than 3 times; failure is logged as a privacy-event metric.

---

## FR-NOTIF-013 — Reopen by owner (no notification) *(decision)*

**Description.**
Reopening a `closed_delivered` post intentionally produces no notification to the recipient (`D-6`). This requirement formalizes that absence.

**Source.**
- Decisions: `D-6`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. The notification dispatcher must **not** emit any push for the reopen event. The recipient observes the change passively when revisiting their closed-posts area.
- AC2. An audit event still records the reopen (`R-MVP-Safety-3`).

---

## FR-NOTIF-014 — User notification preferences

**Description.**
The user controls notifications via two toggles in Settings.

**Source.**
- PRD: `03_Core_Features.md` §3.5.
- Decisions: `D-5`.

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. Toggles: `notif_critical` and `notif_social`. Default: both `true`.
- AC2. Disabling Critical disables every Critical-tagged FR (`FR-NOTIF-001..005`, `FR-NOTIF-009..013`).
- AC3. Disabling Social disables every Social-tagged FR (`FR-NOTIF-006..008`).
- AC4. Toggle changes apply within `NFR-PERF-007` (≤5s end-to-end propagation to the push provider).

**Related.** Screens: 5.1 · Domain: `NotificationPreference`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-015 — Push token lifecycle

**Description.**
Devices register and unregister push tokens.

**Source.**
- PRD: `06_Navigation_Structure.md` §6.6.4 (mobile baseline).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. On sign-in, the client requests OS notification permission and registers an FCM (Android), APNs (iOS), or Web Push subscription with the server.
- AC2. Tokens are stored under `User.devices[]` with `platform` and `last_seen_at`.
- AC3. On sign-out, the corresponding token is deactivated.
- AC4. Tokens not used for 90 days are pruned by `bg-job-token-prune`.
- AC5. Permission denial is recorded; the user can opt back in via OS settings.

**Related.** Domain: `Device`.

---

## FR-NOTIF-016 — Quiet hours (out of scope MVP)

**Description.**
Quiet hours / Do-Not-Disturb scheduling is **not** in MVP. Documented to prevent accidental implementation.

**Source.**
- PRD: `08_Out_of_Scope_and_Future.md` (implicit — single toggle decision).

**Acceptance Criteria.**
- AC1. The Settings UI does not expose quiet-hours controls.
- AC2. The notification dispatcher does not look up time-zone-based suppression; OS-level Do-Not-Disturb is honored implicitly through the OS layer.
