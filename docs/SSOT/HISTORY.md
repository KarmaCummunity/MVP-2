### 🟢 Web deploy pipeline → Cloudflare Pages at `dev3.karma-community-kc.com` (P4.1)
- **SRS**: NFR-PLAT-* — `react-native-web` parity is now deployable to a public URL with auto-deploy on every `main` push and per-PR preview URLs.
- **Branch**: `chore/web-deploy-cloudflare-pages` · 2026-05-10
- **Tests**: tsc clean (5 packages) · 90 vitest passing · `pnpm lint:arch` 180 files passing. Local smoke: `pnpm build:web` produces a 4.43 MB SPA bundle in `app/apps/mobile/dist/`; `pnpm preview:web` serves it with SPA fallback enabled, all routes (`/`, `/donations`, `/chat/abc`) return 200.
- **Design**: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-cloudflare-pages-web-deploy-design.md`](./../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-cloudflare-pages-web-deploy-design.md). Decision: drop the failing Railway auto-detect (no Dockerfile committed → fails every push); Cloudflare Pages is free, native-SPA, and runs entirely outside `.github/workflows/ci.yml` so the mobile CI is untouched.
- **Code**: two scripts on `app/package.json` — `build:web` runs `expo export -p web` then `node scripts/web-postbuild.mjs` which writes `_redirects` (`/* /index.html 200`) into `dist/` so deep-link refresh doesn't 404. `preview:web` uses `serve --single` for the same fallback locally. `dist/` added to `app/apps/mobile/.gitignore`.
- **Runbook**: [`docs/DEPLOY_WEB.md`](./../../docs/DEPLOY_WEB.md) — Cloudflare project settings, Hostinger DNS CNAME for `dev3`, Supabase redirect-URL config, Railway decommission steps, verification curls, troubleshooting table.
- **Manual setup remaining (one-time, in dashboards)**: (1) connect repo in Cloudflare Pages with the documented build command + env vars; (2) add `dev3` CNAME in Hostinger DNS; (3) add `https://dev3.karma-community-kc.com/**` to Supabase Auth → URL Configuration; (4) delete the Railway project to stop the failed-build noise. All four steps documented in `DEPLOY_WEB.md`.

### 🟢 Donation categories + community NGO link lists (FR-DONATE-006..009)
- **SRS**: FR-DONATE-006 (6 new tiles: אוכל / דיור / תחבורה / ידע / חיות / רפואה), FR-DONATE-007 (DonationLinksList component), FR-DONATE-008 (Edge-Function-validated add-link flow), FR-DONATE-009 (report + soft-hide). Augments FR-DONATE-003 AC6 + FR-DONATE-004 AC9 to embed list section under existing Time/Money screens.
- **Branch**: `feat/FR-DONATE-006-donation-categories-and-links` · 2026-05-10
- **Tests**: tsc clean (5 packages) · 79 vitest passing · `pnpm lint:arch` passing (no allowlist additions; entities split into `donations.ts`, list/modal split into focused files + a `useDonationLinkActions` hook)
- **DB**: migration `0014_donation_categories_and_links.sql` — `donation_categories` (lookup, 8 slugs seeded) + `donation_links` (community-curated, RLS: select-visible-or-own-or-admin; insert blocked from clients; update/delete own-or-admin).
- **Edge Function**: `supabase/functions/validate-donation-link` — verifies user JWT, validates inputs, soft rate-limits to 10/user/hour, performs server-side `HEAD` (with `GET` fallback on 405/4xx) reachability check (5s timeout, redirects followed, status 200..399 = ok), inserts via service-role on success.
- **Domain**: `DonationCategorySlug` value-object + `DONATION_CATEGORY_SLUGS`, `DONATION_LINK_*` length/regex constants. `DonationCategory` + `DonationLink` entities in new `donations.ts`.
- **Application**: `IDonationLinksRepository` port (list/addViaEdgeFunction/softHide), `ListDonationLinksUseCase`, `AddDonationLinkUseCase` (client-side input length pre-validation), `RemoveDonationLinkUseCase`, `DonationLinkError`.
- **Infra**: `SupabaseDonationLinksRepository` — list visible rows, invoke Edge Function, soft-hide via UPDATE.
- **Mobile**: dynamic route `/(tabs)/donations/category/[slug].tsx` (hero + DonationLinksList), 6 new tiles in Hub (separated by divider after the existing 3), `<DonationLinksList>` appended to existing Time + Money screens via `embedded` prop. New components: `DonationLinkRow` (favicon + display name + 2-line description + domain chip + open + overflow menu), `AddDonationLinkModal` (URL/name/description form, async validate, inline error per code), `useDonationLinkActions` hook (action sheet + report-via-support-thread + confirm-soft-hide). Composition root extended with the three use-cases.
- **i18n**: `donations.categories.*`, `donations.links.*`, `donations.addLinkModal.*` (Hebrew).
- **Out of scope (deferred)**: pre-moderation queue, periodic dead-link crawler, guest-mirror (still TD-112), super-admin bulk-hide UI (RLS allows it from admin tools).

### 🟢 Feed image rendering + post-detail carousel (FR-POST-014 AC1)
- **SRS**: FR-POST-014 AC1 (post-detail exposes every uploaded image)
- **Branch**: `fix/FR-POST-001-fe-create-post-e2e` (extends the create-post fix below) · 2026-05-09
- **Tests**: tsc clean (5 packages) · 68 vitest passing · `pnpm lint:arch` 124 files passing
- **Tech debt closed**: TD-100 (carousel missing), TD-111 (PostCardGrid never rendered uploaded images)
- **Bug**: after publishing succeeded (the FK fix above), the user reported feed cards still showed only an emoji placeholder (web rendered 🎁; iOS rendered tofu `?` — same Apple-Color-Emoji glyph cache regression as TD-109). Post-detail also exposed only the first image of a multi-image post.
- **PostCardGrid**: now renders `<Image>` from the first `mediaAssets` entry via `getSupabaseClient().storage.from('post-images').getPublicUrl(path)`; falls back to an Ionicons gift/search glyph (consistent with TD-109 closure) when the post has no media.
- **PostImageCarousel** (new component): paged horizontal `FlatList` (no extra deps), counter chip "n / N", animated active dot. Replaces the single-image block in `app/post/[id].tsx`. Falls back to the same Ionicons glyph when empty.
- **Cleanup**: post-detail emoji-as-icon (`🎁 לתת` / `🔍 לבקש`) reduced to plain Hebrew labels in the type tag, since the carousel itself fills the visual hero space.

---

### 🟢 Create-post end-to-end fix (FR-POST-001..004 / FR-POST-019 AC1)
- **SRS**: FR-POST-001 (create), FR-POST-002 AC3 (canonical address) + AC4 (disabled-until-valid Publish), FR-POST-003 AC3 (locationDisplayLevel chooser), FR-POST-004 AC2 (Request can attach optional images), FR-POST-019 AC1 (city is canonical)
- **Branch**: `fix/FR-POST-001-fe-create-post-e2e` · 2026-05-09
- **Tests**: tsc clean (5 packages) · 68 vitest passing (+3 in `CreatePostUseCase` for `street_number` cases) · `pnpm lint:arch` 123 files passing
- **Tech debt closed**: TD-101 (city free-text → `<CityPicker>`), TD-103 (Request couldn't attach images), TD-104 (locationDisplayLevel chooser), TD-105 (Publish enabled with empty fields)
- **Bug fix**: every publish (Give and Request) was returning **400 Bad Request** from `POST /rest/v1/posts`. Root cause was the create form posting free-typed Hebrew text into `posts.city`, which is `text not null references public.cities(city_id)` — a 1,306-row seeded slug table. The FK check rejected the insert before RLS even ran. Secondary risk: `street_number` CHECK regex (`^[0-9]+[A-Za-z]?$`) would also fail on Hebrew letters or punctuation.
- **Domain**: new `STREET_NUMBER_PATTERN` regex constant mirrors the DB CHECK so the pattern lives in one place.
- **Application**: `CreatePostUseCase` now validates `streetNumber` against `STREET_NUMBER_PATTERN` before the network call. New `PostErrorCode`s — `street_number_invalid`, `city_not_found`, `address_invalid`, `forbidden` — surface DB constraint failures as Hebrew messages instead of generic "שגיאת רשת" toasts.
- **Infra**: extracted `mapInsertError()` (own file — keeps `SupabasePostRepository` under TD-50 size cap) translates Postgres error codes 23502/23503/23514/42501 into typed `PostError` instances.
- **UI**: `(tabs)/create.tsx` swaps the city `<TextInput>` for the canonical `<CityPicker>` (already used by `basic-info.tsx` / `edit-profile.tsx`); city state shape becomes `{ id, name } | null`. New `<LocationDisplayLevelChooser>` component (CityOnly / CityAndStreet / FullAddress) replaces the hardcoded `'CityAndStreet'`. `<PhotoPicker>` no longer guarded by `isGive` — Request may attach 0–5 optional images. `isFormValid` derived from required fields disables Publish (visibly dimmed at 0.5 opacity) until ready.
- **Open gaps**: browser end-to-end verification was limited — auth-gated route prevented automated publishing without test credentials. Code paths verified via tsc + 68 vitest + arch-lint; user to confirm publish in their authenticated session.

### 🟢 FR-PROFILE-007 (partial) — Edit Profile + photo-upload encoding fix
- **SRS**: FR-PROFILE-007 AC1 (avatar / display_name / city / biography editable), AC3 (bio URL filter)
- **Branch**: `fix/TD-110-photo-upload-and-edit-profile` · 2026-05-09
- **Tests**: tsc clean (5 packages) · 65 vitest passing (8 new in `auth/UpdateProfileUseCase`) · `pnpm lint:arch` 114 files passing
- **Tech debt closed**: TD-106 (Edit Profile button now navigates to a working screen — Share button still a no-op, deferred)
- **Tech debt partially closed**: TD-40 (`SupabaseUserRepository` adds `setBiography` + `getEditableProfile` — 16 stubs remain)
- **Photo-upload bug fix**: `pickAvatarImage` / `pickPostImages` were uploading **0-byte files** on iOS — `fetch(file://uri).blob()` returns empty / partial Blobs in many SDK 54 builds. Both pipelines now go through `ImageManipulator({ base64: true })` + `base64ToUint8Array` (new `src/services/mediaEncoding.ts`) and upload raw bytes. The user's "I picked an image but profile photo stayed empty" bug is the visible symptom.
- **New screen**: `app/edit-profile.tsx` (180 LOC) + `src/components/EditProfileAvatar.tsx` (77 LOC). Pre-fills via `getEditableProfile`; saves via `UpdateProfileUseCase` (Hebrew validation messages for `invalid_display_name` / `biography_too_long` / `biography_url_forbidden` / `invalid_city`). Avatar replace/remove uses the same pickAvatarImage path as onboarding.
- **Routing**: `app/_layout.tsx` registers `<Stack.Screen name="edit-profile">` with `detailHeader` and `'עריכת פרופיל'` title. `(tabs)/profile.tsx` "ערוך פרופיל" button now `router.push('/edit-profile')`.
- **Open gaps**: full FR-PROFILE-007 — read-only email/phone/SSO display (AC2), URL regex still inline (configurable list per spec is post-MVP), atomic single-statement `update()` deferred to P2.4. UpdateProfileUseCase makes 1–3 sequential setX calls instead of one transaction.

### 🟢 TD-110 — iOS image-picker permission UX + native rebuild
- **SRS**: FR-AUTH-011 AC5 (errors recoverable) — strengthened to "no silent denials"; FR-POST-005 (image upload) — same UX
- **Branch**: `fix/TD-110-image-permission-rebuild` · 2026-05-09
- **Tests**: tsc clean (5 packages) · 57 vitest passing · `pnpm lint:arch` 109 files passing
- **Tech debt closed**: TD-110 (iOS gallery picker dropped the app on iOS 26 because the native build pre-dated `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` + `NSCameraUsageDescription` in `app.json`. Bundle ID also stuck on Xcode default `org.name.app` instead of `com.karmacommunity.app`)
- **Code change**: `pickAvatarImage` (`src/services/avatarUpload.ts`) + `pickPostImages` (`src/services/imageUpload.ts`) now route via `ensureMediaLibraryPermission` / `ensureCameraPermission`. On `canAskAgain === false` (user permanently denied) they show a Hebrew alert with "פתח הגדרות" → `Linking.openSettings()`. First-time denials still return null silently — the next tap re-invokes the system prompt.
- **Native side**: ran `expo prebuild --platform ios --clean` to regenerate `ios/` from the canonical `app.json` (CNG — `app/.gitignore` already lists `ios/`). The new build carries the usage descriptions + correct bundle ID.
- **Open gaps**: Web has no permission concept (browser handles it). Android side will pick up the same `app.json` config on its next prebuild.

### 🟢 TD-109 — emoji literals → Ionicons across tab bar + EmptyState
- **SRS**: SRS §6.1 (tabs icon-only) — visual fidelity restored cross-platform
- **Branch**: `fix/TD-109-replace-emoji-icons` · 2026-05-09
- **Tests**: tsc clean (5 packages) · 57 vitest passing · `pnpm lint:arch` 109 files passing
- **Tech debt closed**: TD-109 (iOS 26 simulator rendered emoji glyphs as `?` tofu boxes — Apple Color Emoji font wasn't reliably available across simulator boots / Metro reloads)
- **Files touched**: `src/components/TabBar.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`, `src/components/EmptyState.tsx` (API change: `emoji: string` → `icon: keyof typeof Ionicons.glyphMap`); 5 callers updated (`post/[id].tsx`, `(tabs)/profile.tsx`, `user/[handle].tsx`, `chat/index.tsx`, `src/components/PostFeedList.tsx`)
- **Open gaps**: None. `(tabs)/_layout.tsx`'s active-state colour now drives the highlight (previously emoji-opacity), aligning with how `<TabBar />` already worked

---

### 🟢 Audit P0.3 + P0.4 spec→impl + fix F1 (owner self-chat CTA)
- **SRS**: FR-POST-015 AC1 (owner-mode CTA differentiation) — direct fix · audit covered FR-AUTH-011, FR-AUTH-014, FR-AUTH-015, FR-POST-001..010, FR-FEED-001..005
- **Branch**: `fix/FR-POST-015-owner-mode-cta` · 2026-05-09
- **Tests**: tsc clean (5 packages) · 57 vitest passing · `pnpm lint:arch` passing · `post/[id].tsx` 189 LOC (under 200 cap)
- **Tech debt closed**: F1 (owner viewing own post saw "Send Message to Poster" — tap created chat with self). `app/post/[id].tsx` now branches on `isOwner = post.ownerId === viewerId`; viewer-mode CTA stays for non-owners, owner sees a placeholder hint until P0.6 closure controls land
- **Tech debt added** (new TDs from the audit): TD-100 (image carousel), TD-101 (city free-text — data corruption 🔴), TD-102 (guest overlay count hardcoded), TD-103 (Request can't attach images), TD-104 (locationDisplayLevel chooser missing), TD-105 (Publish enabled w/empty required), TD-106 (Profile dead buttons), TD-107 (Settings dead rows), TD-108 (avatar Storage leak)
- **Recent fixes verified in code** (PRs #21–#24): web OAuth popup close (`auth/callback.tsx:51-59`), onboarding reset on web (`settings.tsx:58-69` platform-branched), global TabBar on detail screens (`_layout.tsx:48-55`), `users.avatar_url` column (`SupabaseUserRepository:58`), iOS avatar picker (square crop client-side via ImageManipulator). All confirmed correct
- **Open gaps**: TD-100..108 (above) — TD-101 is the priority since it's silently corrupting data. FR-POST-015 AC2/AC3 visibility banners (OnlyMe/FollowersOnly) intentionally deferred from this fix to keep `post/[id].tsx` under the 200 LOC cap; they ride along the next P0.6 owner-mode UI slice

---

### 🟢 P0.3.b — FR-AUTH-011 onboarding photo upload (camera + gallery + Storage)
- **SRS**: FR-AUTH-011 AC1 (camera + gallery), AC2 (resize 1024 + JPEG q=0.85), AC3 (skip → silhouette via `AvatarInitials`), AC4 (SSO-prefilled, replaceable, removable), AC5 (errors recoverable — Alert + Skip remains available)
- **Branch**: `feat/FR-AUTH-011-onboarding-photo` · 2026-05-08
- **Tests**: 57 vitest passing (5 new in `auth/SetAvatarUseCase`) · tsc clean (5 packages) · `pnpm lint:arch` 105 files passing
- **Tech debt closed**: TD-22 (P0.3 onboarding wizard fully done — slices A + B + C); also closes the FR-AUTH-011 piece of TD-22 entirely
- **Tech debt partially closed**: TD-40 (`SupabaseUserRepository.setAvatar` wired — 18 stubs remaining)
- **New migration**: `0009_init_avatars_bucket.sql` — `avatars` Storage bucket (public-read, owner-folder RLS, 512KB cap, image/jpeg only). Same posture as `post-images`; both tracked under TD-11 for pre-launch tightening to signed URLs.
- **Operator**: 0009 applied ✅ 2026-05-08
- **Open gaps**: Camera capture is mobile-only (web users get gallery-only — `isCameraAvailable === false`). Server-side EXIF Edge Function still pending (TD-23). FR-PROFILE-007 Edit Profile photo replace will reuse `SetAvatarUseCase` + `pickAvatarImage` + `resizeAndUploadAvatar` when P2.4 lands.

---

### 🟢 P0.4-FE — Feed UI + Create form (mock retirement + image upload)
- **SRS**: FR-POST-001..006, FR-POST-008 (read-side via UpdatePostUseCase use-case ready), FR-POST-010, FR-POST-014, FR-POST-015, FR-FEED-001..005, FR-FEED-013, FR-PROFILE-001 (partial), FR-AUTH-014 (partial — guest feed now live)
- **Branch**: `feat/FR-POST-001-fe-feed-create` · 2026-05-08 · PR #14
- **Tests**: 52 vitest passing (27 new in `posts/*` + `feed/GetFeedUseCase` — FakePostRepository + 5 use-case suites); tsc clean (5 packages); `pnpm lint:arch` 102 files passing
- **Tech debt closed**: TD-13 (full — read/create/update/delete adapter consumers wired; close/reopen still `not_implemented('P0.6')` per scope), TD-32 (post/[id] silent fallback → not-found state), AUDIT-P0-01, AUDIT-P0-11 (image picker + resize + upload), AUDIT-P2-02 + TD-5 (mock/data.ts deleted)
- **Tech debt partially closed**: TD-23 (image upload + client-side EXIF strip via re-encode shipped; **server-side EXIF Edge Function still pending — AUDIT-X-03**), TD-29 (`(tabs)/index.tsx` 136 LOC, `(tabs)/profile.tsx` 214, `post/[id].tsx` 165, `(tabs)/create.tsx` ~250 — under or near cap; allowlist mostly-respected), TD-42 (active-posts counter wired via `countOpenByUser`; followers/following/items_given/items_received still `0` pending TD-40 / P2.4)
- **Open gaps**: FR-POST-006 AC2/AC3 visibility interstitials · FR-POST-007 local draft autosave · FR-POST-008 image-edit (depends on BE update() mediaAssets) · FR-FEED-006..015 (P1.2 / TD-26) · FollowersOnly visibility option in create form (TD-40 / P2.4) · TD-41 SQL probes for SECURITY DEFINER predicates (Public path only exercised here)

---

### 🟢 P0.4-BE — Posts repository adapter (Supabase)
- **SRS**: FR-POST-001..004, 008..011, 014; FR-FEED-001..005, 013
- **Branch**: `feat/FR-POST-001-be-posts-repo` · 2026-05-08
- **Tests**: tsc clean (all 5 packages); 25/25 vitest still green; no new tests (adapter mirrors `SupabaseAuthService` precedent — see TD-50)
- **Tech debt**: TD-13 partially resolved (close/reopen still stubbed for P0.6); adds TD-50 (no-tests for infra adapters)
- **Open gaps**: FR-CLOSURE-* close/reopen (P0.6) · image upload from device FR-POST-005 (P0.4-FE) · realtime feed FR-FEED-014 (P1.2) · `update()` does not change mediaAssets (image swap on edit deferred)

---

### 🟢 P0.3.c — FR-AUTH-015 soft gate before first meaningful action
- **SRS**: FR-AUTH-015 AC1 (modal mirrors basic-info form: display_name 1–50 + city + single "שמור והמשך" button), AC2 (Cancel = no side effects, returns to previous screen), AC3 (after save, deferred action proceeds)
- **Branch**: `feat/FR-AUTH-015-fe-soft-gate` · 2026-05-08
- **Files added**: `apps/mobile/src/components/OnboardingSoftGate.tsx` (provider + hook), `apps/mobile/src/components/OnboardingSoftGateModal.tsx`
- **Files changed**: `apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx` (wraps Stack with SoftGateProvider inside AuthGate), `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/create.tsx` (publish gated via `requestSoftGate(publish)`)
- **Tests**: 25/25 vitest · tsc clean (5 packages) · turbo lint = no-op (no lint task wired)
- **Tech debt**: None
- **Open gaps**: Other meaningful-action triggers in FR-AUTH-015 description (follow another user, send first chat message) wire later — `useSoftGate().requestSoftGate()` consumed by P1.1 follow buttons and P0.5 chat send when those land. Today only create-post publish is gated.

---

### 🟢 P0.3.a polish — Skip on every screen, dynamic cities, dev reset
- **SRS**: FR-AUTH-010 AC2+AC3, FR-AUTH-011 AC3, FR-AUTH-012 AC2
- **Branch**: `fix/onboarding-polish` · 2026-05-07
- **Tests**: 25/25 vitest · tsc clean (all 5 packages)
- **Tech debt**: Closes IL_CITIES oversight from slice A
- **Open gaps**: FR-AUTH-015 soft-gate (slice C) · photo full upload FR-AUTH-011 AC1+AC2 (slice B) · prod reset needs FR-AUTH-016 (P2.2)
- **Operator**: 0008 applied ✅

---

### 🟢 P0.3.a — Onboarding wizard (Basic Info + Tour, photo skip-stub)
- **SRS**: FR-AUTH-010 AC1+AC2+AC4, FR-AUTH-011 AC3+AC4+AC5, FR-AUTH-012 AC1–AC4, FR-AUTH-007 AC2
- **Branch**: `feat/FR-AUTH-010-onboarding-wizard` · 2026-05-07
- **Tests**: 25/25 vitest (6 new) · tsc clean (all 5 packages)
- **Tech debt**: TD-40 (SupabaseUserRepository stubs — fill in P0.4/P1.1/P1.4/P2.4)
- **Open gaps**: FR-AUTH-011 AC1+AC2 photo upload (slice B) · FR-AUTH-015 soft-gate (slice C) · FR-AUTH-010 AC3 explicit Skip affordance on basic-info

---

### 🟢 P0.2.f1 — Users Realtime publication
- **SRS**: FR-PROFILE-013 AC5, NFR-PERF-005
- **Branch**: `feat/p0-2-f1-users-realtime-and-td39` · 2026-05-07
- **Tech debt**: TD-39 (internal counter columns readable by non-owners of Public profiles — IUserRepository adapter MUST use `active_posts_count_for_viewer()`, never raw `_internal`)
- **Operator**: 0007 applied ✅

---

### 🟢 P0.2.f — Stats projections + counter triggers + community_stats
- **SRS**: FR-STATS-001..006, FR-PROFILE-013, FR-FEED-014+015, FR-CLOSURE-008 (data shape only), FR-PROFILE-001 AC2
- **Branch**: `feat/p0-2-f-stats-counters` · 2026-05-07
- **Tech debt**: Closes TD-21 · TD-20 open (activity timeline + nightly recompute job, P1.6)
- **Open gaps**: FR-STATS-003 activity timeline (app layer, P1.6) · FR-STATS-005 nightly `bg-job-stats-recompute` (P1.6) · FR-CLOSURE-008 Edge Function (P0.6) · `community_stats` is a view not MV (acceptable until scale)
- **Operator**: 0006 applied ✅

---

### 🟢 P0.2.e — Moderation schema
- **SRS**: FR-MOD-001+002+005+008+010+011+012, FR-CHAT-009+010
- **Branch**: `feat/p0-2-e-moderation-schema` · 2026-05-07
- **Tech debt**: TD-38 (sanction escalation 7d→30d→permanent is schema-only; escalation logic ships with FR-ADMIN-*)
- **Open gaps**: Notifications on auto-removal (FR-NOTIF, P1.5) · forbidden-keyword detection (future content-moderation service) · FR-ADMIN-002 restore action
- **Operator**: 0005 applied ✅

---

### 🟢 P0.2.d — Chat & Messaging schema
- **SRS**: FR-CHAT-001..007+009+011+012+013
- **Branch**: `feat/p0-2-d-chat-messaging` · 2026-05-07
- **Tech debt**: Adds `has_blocked` + `is_chat_visible_to` SECURITY DEFINER — same audit posture as P0.2.c
- **Open gaps**: Unread badge computed client-side (not denormalized) · FR-CHAT-013 AC3 90-day archive is post-MVP
- **Operator**: 0004 applied ✅

---

### 🟢 P0.2.c — Following & Blocking schema
- **SRS**: FR-FOLLOW-001..006+008+009+012, FR-MOD-003+004+009, FR-PROFILE-003
- **Branch**: `feat/p0-2-c-following-blocking` · 2026-05-07
- **Tech debt**: Closes P0.2.b `is_post_visible_to()` placeholder for FollowersOnly + block short-circuit
- **Open gaps**: Notifications on follow/request/approval (FR-NOTIF, P1.5) · `is_blocked` + `is_following` are SECURITY DEFINER — intentional (visibility predicates need to read both directions)
- **Operator**: 0003 applied ✅

---

### 🟢 P0.2.b — Posts core schema
- **SRS**: FR-POST-001..020, FR-FEED-001+002, FR-CLOSURE-002+003
- **Branch**: `feat/p0-2-db-schema-rls` · 2026-05-07
- **Tech debt**: TD-11 (storage bucket public-read — tighten to signed URLs at scale)
- **Open gaps**: `is_post_visible_to()` FollowersOnly placeholder → resolved P0.2.c ✅ · counter triggers → resolved P0.2.f ✅
- **Operator**: 0002 applied ✅

---

### ✅ P0.2.a — Foundation & Identity
- **SRS**: FR-AUTH-003+006+010..012+016(enum), FR-PROFILE-001..007+013
- **Branch**: `feat/p0-2-db-schema-rls` commit `1a04f0f` · 2026-05-07
- **Tech debt**: TD-1 ✅ resolved 2026-05-07
- **Open gaps**: Approved-follower expansion for Private profiles → P0.2.c ✅ · counter triggers → P0.2.f ✅
- **Operator**: 0001 applied ✅

---

### ✅ UX polish — Tab bar + Profile labels + Real Google identity on AuthSession
- **SRS**: FR-AUTH-003 AC5, FR-PROFILE-001 AC4+AC6, PRD §6.1.2
